Hi. I do **ruby** & **Elixir** & **Js**.

In my free time when I ever have, I watch **Harry Potter**, **Pirates of the Caribbean**. 

If you have watched HP. there was a scene in which **Professor Severus Snape** and **Professor Albus Dumbledore** were talking to each other and

**Professor Albus Dumbledore** said: Lilly!!!

**Professor Severus Snape** said: *Always*!!

That's was defining a moment of the whole MOVIE series If you can feel it. **You are on the right path my friend.**

Last but not the least, I like/love/adore **Phil Dunphy** If you haven't watched **Modern Family** then do watch it.

I also wrote a medium article on [hot upgrades with Distillery.][1]

**Ashfaq Ahmad** & [**Dave Thomas**][2] are my ideals.

I do love to play snooker and **Ronnie O'Sullivan** is my most favorite player, He is genius, you should check him out on youtube.
