 You can call me a Full Stack Programmer, 

1. who has been involved in the early years of Evercam.io when we were migrating from Sinatra to Phoenix (Ruby to Elixir, 2016 to 2021 mainly then bits and pieces), also migrated the ruby on rails applications to VueJS

2. as well as Integration of Meddy and Helium Health (Yes, no need to stand up but I built the backend for that.) (https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/nigerias-helium-health-acquires-uaes-meddy-in-rare-africa-gcc-deal/),

3. not only that, but I also build the core Ruby on Rails Application for EOT (https://github.com/EyesOfThings/Mobile_Camera_Demonstrator), Eyes of Things, (https://eyesofthings.eu/?page_id=228).

4. besides all the above, I also wrote an article on Elixir Hot code Upgrades, ( Harry Potter Addition ) https://medium.com/@junaid_16874/hot-upgrades-whaaaaaaaat-29bad102795e

Yeah, I have done a few things, just don't want to brag about it, you know!?

Currently, I am working in Elixir, Phoenix / Ruby and VueJS, NustJs, AWS Servies, Seaweedfs, RAID stuff, NewRelic, and MERN Stack. I don't like Angular, so :)
